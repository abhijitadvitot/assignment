Q1. What are the major features in different versions of Spring Framework?
Ans:
Dependency injection, events, resources,
 validation, data binding, type conversion, spel, aop. Transactions, DAO support, JDBC, ORM, XML.
 ----------------------------------------------------
Q2. What is a Spring Framework?
Ans:
Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support
 for developing Java applications.
 Spring enables you to build applications from plain old Java objects (POJOs) 
and to apply enterprise services non-invasively to POJOs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q3. List the advantages of Spring Framework
Ans:
Light Weight:
         Spring is a lightweight framework because of its POJO implementation.
         It does not force the programmer to inherit any class and implement any interface.
          With the help of Spring, we can enable powerful, scalable applications using POJOs (Plain Old Java Object).

Flexible:
           It provides flexible libraries trusted by developers all over the world. The developer can choose either XML or Java-based annotations for configuration options. The IoC and DI features provide the foundation for a wide-ranging set of features and functionality. It makes the job simpler.
  
Loose Coupling:
           Spring applications are loosely coupled because of dependency injection. 
           It handles injecting dependent components without a component knowing where they came from.
 
Powerful Abstraction:
           It provides a powerful abstraction to JEE specifications such as JMS, JDBC, JPA, and JTA.

Declarative Support:
           It provides declarative support for caching, validation, transaction, and formatting.

Portable: 
           We can use server-side in web/EJB app, client-side in swing app business logic is completely portable.

Cross-cutting behavior:
           Resource management is a cross-cutting concern, easy to copy and paste everywhere.

Configuration: 

           It provides a consistent way of configuring everything, separate configuration from application logic, varying configuration.
Lifecycle:

           Responsible for managing all your application components, particularly those in middle-tier container sees components through well-defined lifecycle: init(), destroy().

Dependency Injection:

       The use of dependency injection makes the easy development of JavaEE.

Q4. What are the different features of Spring Framework?
Ans:
IOC (Inversion of Control) Container. ...
Support for aspect-oriented programing. ...
Data access framework. ...
Transaction management framework. ...
Spring MVC framework. ...
Spring web service. ...
Spring test frameworks. ...
Core container.
---------------------------

Q5. How many modules are there in Spring Framework and what are they?

Ans:The Spring Framework consists of features organized into about 20 modules. 
These modules are grouped into
Core Container
Data Access/Integration
Web
AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming)
Instrumentation
Test
---------------------
Q6. What is a Spring configuration file?
Ans:
  Spring configuration file is a file with . xml extension and the file contains information
  about the classes and interfaces and their dependencies.
  Using this file the spring container controls the life cycle of a spring bean and also Dependency Injection is achieved.
-----------------------------------------

Q7. What are the different components of a Spring application?
Ans:The Spring framework consists of seven modules
 These modules are Spring Core, Spring AOP, Spring Web MVC, Spring DAO, Spring ORM, Spring context, and Spring Web flow
-----------------------------
Q8. What are the various ways of using Spring Framework?
Ans:
 Using Spring.io initializer 
 Using Eclipse or any similar IDE and Maven simple project
 Using Spring Tool Suite
 Using CLI
---------------------------

Q9. What is Spring IOC Container?
Ans:
Spring IoC Container is the core of Spring Framework.
 It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle.
 The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the components that make up the application
-----------------------------------------------
Q10. What do you mean by Dependency Injection?
Ans:
Dependency Injection is a fundamental aspect of the Spring framework, 
through which the Spring container “injects” objects into other objects or “dependencies”.
 Simply put, this allows for loose coupling of components and moves the responsibility 
of managing components onto the container.
